# musikr

Musikr *was intended* to be a command line music tagger and tagging library.
However, I bit off far more than I could chew here and ended up losing interest
in this project. It now sits here as a warning to myself not to obsessively focus
on something incredibly niche and waste valuable time in the process.

If someone else wants to pick up the mantle here and complete it, fine by them,
but I feel like functionaltiy like this would be far more useful if it was bundled
with a generic muxing library. I now just use `ffmpeg` to change metadata from the
commandline.
