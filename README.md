# musikr

Musikr is a command-line music tagger and tagging library.

**Note:** Musikr is a WORK-IN-PROGRESS and is not suitable for use.

```
What's working:
- id3v2 Tag Reading [Lib + CLI]
- id3v2 Tag Writing [Lib]

What I need to do:
- proper cli commands for read/write
- vorbis read/write
- mp4 read/write
- ape read/write
```
